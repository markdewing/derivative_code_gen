# Symbolic Derivatives with Code Generation

This project expresses scientific computation in a form that is more like symbolic mathematics.  It performs derivatives on that representation, and then converts to a regular programming language.  It's similar to auto-differentiation, but the diffentiation is done on a different representation.

The representation is a structured collection of statements with the symbolic part using Sympy.
