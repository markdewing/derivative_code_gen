## Program development path

Logical steps along the path of developing the code that increase in complexity.

* [Step 01](step_01) - Initial program representation
* [Step 02](step_02) - Initial derivative of routine
* [Step 03](step_03) - Testing and test support code
* [Step 04](step_04) - Code generation
